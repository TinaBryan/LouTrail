We are creating an app which routes visitors to city wide events around Derby time.  These are, in particular, foodie oriented restaurants and local eateries. Vistors can check in to a place and can win prizes after visiting a certain number of places.  This app is intended to increase the traffic to other less well-known, but unique areas of Louisville.
